# 13-ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description 
Build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

*WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
*WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
*WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
*WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
*WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
